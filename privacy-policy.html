<h4>Information you provide to us directly</h4>
<p>You can use some of our Portal Services without providing us with any personal information. However, when you register for an Account, you provide us with personal information, including items such as your name and email address. Using your Account and accessing other portions of our Portal Services may require that you enter a password or other credentials.

<h4>Information we may collect indirectly</h4>
<p>We use browser cookies and similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and store certain information when you use, access, or interact with our Portal Services.</p>
<p>Cookies are small files of information, usually stored on your application, computer or device, that allows our web servers or our third-party services to recognize you. We store information that we collect through Cookies to record your preferences, settings and status for the Portal Services and to analyze how you use the Portal Services. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the information referenced above in this paragraph may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. (More details below under the section entitled “Your Choices and Rights.”)</p>
<p>With Cookies, we may, for example, collect information about the type of device you use to access the Portal Services, the operating system and version, your IP address, your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your browser type, and data on your interaction with the Portal Services (such as search terms you enter or your frequency of usage, including your usage across different websites and applications). We may also collect data regarding the functionality of our Portal Services, including system-level metrics, to help us operate, maintain and improve the performance and utilization of the Portal Services, to develop new features, protect the security and safety of our Portal Services and our customers, and to provide customer support. We also use this data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.</p>
<h4>Information we may collect from third party sources</h4>
<p>We may receive information about you from third parties that help us update, expand, and analyse our records, and to prevent or detect fraud. If you choose to link our Portal Services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize linking. Please note that the information we may receive is governed by the privacy settings, policies, and/or procedures of the third party.</p>

<p>Employees and Contractors of Everdome. Our employees and contractors may be given access to any information which we collect via our Portal Services.

<p>Business Transfers. Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets;</p>

<p>Aggregate Information. As legally permissible, we may use and share information about Users with our partners in aggregated or de-identified form that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
<h2>Legal Basis for Using Personal Information</h2>
<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>However, we normally collect and use your personal information only when doing so (a) is needed in order to perform our contractual or legal obligations to you; (b) is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (c) is done with your consent. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Portal Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Portal Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform our contractual obligations with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and will advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory, which includes the possible consequences of not providing your personal information.</p>
<p>You may withdraw any consent you have granted for use of your personal information by contacting us through the information we provide under the section entitled “Contact Us” below. When required by applicable law, we will rely on your consent for direct marketing and to collect information from your device or computer.</p>
<h2>How We Protect and Store The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We deploy administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements and safeguard the information that we collect.</p>
<p>However, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks, may be compromised.</p>
<p>The Portal Services are controlled and operated by Everdome.io. We may store the information we collect in the EEA or in other countries where we or our service providers have facilities. We may transfer information to countries outside of your country of residence which may have data protection laws and regulations that differ from those in your country.</p>
<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).</p>
<p>We retain the information we collect for no longer than is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information and to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<h2>Third-party Services And Content</h2>
<p>Our Portal Services may include integrated content (such as video materials) or links to content or services provided by third parties (such as on outside websites). This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy, security, or other practices of the third parties that provide such content or services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies and their terms of service.</p>
<p>We engage third parties that support the operation of our Portal Services, such as analytics providers. These third parties may use technologies to track your online activities over time and across different websites and online platforms.</p>

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about our data practices, please contact us at marketing@Everdome.io\n\nWe recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or about our data practices, please contact us at marketing@Everdome.io\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes:\n\n-   the types of information we may collect;\n\n-   how we use the information we collect;\n\n-   how we may share the information we collect;\n\n-   the legal basis for using personal information;\n\n-   how we protect and store the information we collect;\n\n-   third-party services and content;\n\n-   your choices and rights;\n\n-   changes to this Privacy Policy; and\n\n-   how to contact us\n\n## The Types of Information We Collect\n\nWe may collect and receive information about you from various sources, including: (a) directly from you when you provide it to us, (b) indirectly from you when you use the Portal Services, and (c) from third-party websites, services, and partners.\n\n“Personal information” is any information that can be used to identify you or that we can link to you as an individual. We collect your personal information when you provide it to us.\n\n#### Information you provide to us directly\n\nYou can use some of our Portal Services without providing us with any personal information. However, when you register for an Account, you provide us with personal information, including items such as your name and email address. Using your Account and accessing other portions of our Portal Services may require that you enter a password or other credentials. Your password or credentials are stored locally on your device or computer, and they are never transmitted to us.\n\nIf you contact us directly, we may also receive personal information and other information about you, such as your name, title, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.\n\n#### Information we may collect indirectly\n\nWe use browser cookies and similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and store certain information when you use, access, or interact with our Portal Services.\n\nCookies are small files of information, usually stored on your application, computer or device, that allows our web servers or our third-party services to recognize you. We store information that we collect through Cookies to record your preferences, settings and status for the Portal Services and to analyze how you use the Portal Services. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the information referenced above in this paragraph may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws. (More details below under the section entitled “Your Choices and Rights.”)\n\nWith Cookies, we may, for example, collect information about the type of device you use to access the Portal Services, the operating system and version, your IP address, your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your browser type, and data on your interaction with the Portal Services (such as search terms you enter or your frequency of usage, including your usage across different websites and applications). We may also collect data regarding the functionality of our Portal Services, including system-level metrics, to help us operate, maintain and improve the performance and utilization of the Portal Services, to develop new features, protect the security and safety of our Portal Services and our customers, and to provide customer support. We also use this data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.\n\n#### Information we may collect from third party sources\n\nWe may receive information about you from third parties that help us update, expand, and analyse our records, and to prevent or detect fraud. If you choose to link our Portal Services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account, to authorize linking. Please note that the information we may receive is governed by the privacy settings, policies, and/or procedures of the third party.\n\nWe may also collect information from social media platforms that share information about how you interact with our social media content. Further, we may also receive publicly-available information about you from our third-party partners and combine it with data that we have about you.\n\n## How We Use the Information We Collect\n\nWe use the information we collect in various ways, including to:\n\n-   provide, operate, and maintain our Portal Services;\n\n-   improve, personalize, and expand our Portal Services;\n\n-   understand and analyze how you use our Portal Services;\n\n-   develop new products, services, features, and functionality;\n\n-   communicate with you (either directly or through one of our partners) in order to provide customer service, to provide updates and other information relating to the Portal Services;\n\n-   market or promote our Portal Services (including to maintain our list of contacts, or to assess the effectiveness of our events, promotional campaigns and publications);\n\n-   understand how people use our Portal Services, including by generating and analysing statistics;\n\n-   support Everdome business purposes, including data analysis; invoicing, detecting, preventing, and responding to actual or potential fraud, illegal activities, or intellectual property infringement; and\n\n-   comply and enforce applicable regulations and agreements, including enforcing our Terms of Service, or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.\n\n-   The above uses may involve information that has been aggregated so that the data is no longer capable of identifying an individual. This aggregated data may also be used by us to generate and commercialize insights.\n\n## How We May Share the Information We Collect\n\nWe may share the personal information we collect with Everdome.io. We may also share the information we collect in various ways, including the following:\n\nOther Users. We may share your information with Certifiers, Relying Parties and other Users on the Marketplace Platform and elsewhere in the Portal;\n\nEmployees and Contractors of Everdome. Our employees and contractors may be given access to any information which we collect via our Portal Services. Our employees and contractors are required to keep this information confidential and are not permitted to use it for any purposes other than to enable you to use the Portal Services or to deal with requests that you submit to us.\n\nVendors and Service Providers. We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that provide services on our behalf in order to allow them to assist us in (a) providing our Portal Services, (b) promoting and/or marketing our Portal Services or other services or products, and (c) providing you with information, such as product announcements, software updates, special offers.\n\nAdvertising. We work with third-party advertising partners to show you ads that we think may interest you. These advertising partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies on our Portal Services, and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you which they may collect over time and across different online services. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance. To learn more about these programs, or opt-out of personalized ads, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory program for Online Behavioral Advertising.\n\nThird-Party Partners. We also share information about Users with third-party partners in order to receive additional publicly-available information about you;\n\nInformation We Share When You Sign Up Through a Referral. If you sign up for an Account through a referral from a friend, we may share information with your referrer to let them know that you used their referral to sign up;\n\nAnalytics. We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect non-identifying information. Google provides some additional privacy options regarding its Analytics cookies\n\nBusiness Transfers. Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to any potential acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any proposed merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets;\n\nAs Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may also share information to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (b) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof or thereof; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (d) respond to your requests; or (e) protect our rights, property or safety, our Users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention;\n\nWith Your Consent. We may share information with your consent;\n\nAggregate Information. As legally permissible, we may use and share information about Users with our partners in aggregated or de-identified form that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\n\n## Legal Basis for Using Personal Information\n\nOur legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\n\nHowever, we normally collect and use your personal information only when doing so (a) is needed in order to perform our contractual or legal obligations to you; (b) is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights; or (c) is done with your consent. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Portal Services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these Portal Services, for example when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.\n\nIf we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform our contractual obligations with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and will advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory, which includes the possible consequences of not providing your personal information.\n\nYou may withdraw any consent you have granted for use of your personal information by contacting us through the information we provide under the section entitled “Contact Us” below. When required by applicable law, we will rely on your consent for direct marketing and to collect information from your device or computer.\n\n## How We Protect and Store The Information We Collect\n\nWe deploy administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to comply with applicable legal requirements and safeguard the information that we collect.\n\nHowever, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. Moreover, information you transmit to us over networks that we do not control, including the Internet and wireless networks, may be compromised.\n\nThe Portal Services are controlled and operated by Everdome.io. We may store the information we collect in the EEA or in other countries where we or our service providers have facilities. We may transfer information to countries outside of your country of residence which may have data protection laws and regulations that differ from those in your country.\n\nWe retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).\n\nWe retain the information we collect for no longer than is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect the information and to comply with our legal obligations.\n\n## Third-party Services And Content\n\nOur Portal Services may include integrated content (such as video materials) or links to content or services provided by third parties (such as on outside websites). This Privacy Policy does not address the privacy, security, or other practices of the third parties that provide such content or services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies and their terms of service.\n\nWe engage third parties that support the operation of our Portal Services, such as analytics providers. These third parties may use technologies to track your online activities over time and across different websites and online platforms.\n\n## Your Choices And Rights\n\nYou have choices and certain rights that can affect the collection and sharing of your information.\n\n#### Your Choices\n\nChoices that can affect the collection and sharing of your information include the following:\n\nYou can use some of the features of the Portal Services without an Account, thereby limiting the type of information that we collect;\n\nYou may unsubscribe from receiving certain promotional emails from us.
